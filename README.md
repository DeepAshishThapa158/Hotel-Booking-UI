Project Description
The Hotel Booking System (Frontend) is a fully responsive web application designed to simulate a hotel booking experience. It features a modern and visually appealing interface with sections like a login form, a static room information page, and an automatic sliding review carousel. This project focuses on front-end design and interactivity without backend functionality.
